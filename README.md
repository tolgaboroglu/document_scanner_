Hi,Excited to share a peek at our document scanner app demo—created with a German client. It automates scanning and text conversion from receipts and documents.
For freelancers eyeing comprehensive projects:
1️⃣ Problem Understanding: Listen, understand.
2️⃣ Planning: Solid plan, tech choices.
3️⃣ Data Prep: OCR for text extraction.
4️⃣ Data Processing: Manual labeling, BIO tagging.
5️⃣ Prediction & Boxes: NER model predicts, places bounding boxes.
6️⃣ Document Scanner: OpenCV locates and extracts business cards.
Effective planning and data prep are vital for freelance success. Manage projects efficiently by following these steps. 👨‍💻💼

👉Note: Codes and datasets from the freelance project weren't used for contract compliance❗
👉Extra Note: Our web app lets users upload docs, auto-scan, and extract text. An interactive feature allows users to adjust bounding box coordinates after business card detection, personalizing text for easy download and sharing.
