# Document Scanner App


Hi,Excited to share a peek at our document scanner app demo—created with a German client. It automates scanning and text conversion from receipts and documents.
For freelancers eyeing comprehensive projects:
* Problem Understanding: Listen, understand.
* Planning: Solid plan, tech choices.
* Data Prep: OCR for text extraction.
* Data Processing: Manual labeling, BIO tagging.
* Prediction & Boxes: NER model predicts, places bounding boxes.
* Document Scanner: OpenCV locates and extracts business cards.
  
Effective planning and data prep are vital for freelance success. Manage projects efficiently by following these steps. 👨‍💻💼

* Note: Codes and datasets from the freelance project weren't used for contract compliance❗
* Extra Note: Our web app lets users upload docs, auto-scan, and extract text. An interactive feature allows users to adjust bounding box coordinates after business card detection, personalizing text for easy download and sharing.
