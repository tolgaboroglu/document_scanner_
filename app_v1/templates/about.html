<h3>Welcome to Our Exciting Project!</h3>

    <p>In this project, we will explore the fascinating world of leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. Our focus is on developing a customized solution that addresses specific challenges in data extraction and analysis.</p>

    <p>
        Throughout the project, we will employ a combination of advanced techniques in computer vision and natural language processing. Our goal is to create a robust system capable of handling diverse types of data sources and extracting valuable insights.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Technologies Used:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Computer Vision</li>
            <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        In the Computer Vision module, we'll tackle tasks such as document scanning, text localization, and extraction. Moving on to Natural Language Processing, we'll delve into entity recognition and perform necessary text cleaning and parsing.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Key Python Libraries Utilized:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>OpenCV</li>
        <li>Numpy</li>
        <li>SpaCy</li>
        <li>Pandas</li>
        <li>Other relevant libraries</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        As we combine these two major technologies, we'll break down the project into several developmental stages for clarity and ease of understanding.
